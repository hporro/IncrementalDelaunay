# Incremental Delaunay Triangulation visualization

Incremental Delaunay triangulation with visualization. It was implemented using C++, CMake, imgui, glm, gl3w and glfw. It is the first assignement in the course CC5501-1 Mallas Geom√©tricas y Aplicaciones, of the University Of Chile.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

To run the project, you will need to have installed glfw library in your computer. If you have a ubuntu distro, you only need to run:

```
sudo apt-get install libglfw3
sudo apt-get install libglfw3-dev
```

Other than that, you only need a graphics card capable to run OpenGL 3.2 core profile, CMake (version 3.1 or more) and a C++ compiler capable to compile C++11 (g++-4.8 or more works).

### Installing

```
git clone https://github.com/hporro/Tarea1Mallas
cd Tarea1Mallas
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

### Running

Then you can run the main application running the main executable file, in the build directory:

```
./main
```

## Running the tests

To run the tests, you have to run the tests executable in the build folder:

```
./tests
```
